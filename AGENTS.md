# Repository guidance

## Indexer topology

Every adapter that needs a Sentio indexer gets its own processor project. Never
share one project across protocols, even when the entity schemas would fit in a
single processor:

- one `SentioIndexerConfig` per protocol ID, supplied by the host service as a
  distinct project and processor version;
- the generic indexer clients (`ownerTokenIndexer`, `accountRequestIndexer`) are
  shared *code*, not a shared deployment — reuse the client, keep the project
  separate;
- a protocol's backfill state, checkpoint lag, and schema migrations must never
  be able to stall or break an unrelated protocol's positions;
- adding a protocol means a new project, a new processor version, and new host
  configuration — never an extra contract binding inside another protocol's
  processor.

## Deployment windows

Every contract address the kernel reads — hardcoded anchors, manifest entries, and
registries alike — must be gated by the block that created it:

- an `eth_call` against an address that has no code yet returns empty data, which
  fails strict batch decoding and drops the protocol's whole surface for every
  fixed-block scan inside the gap (an Aave v4 hub deployed late broke historical
  scans across a 600k-block interval exactly this way);
- carry a `deploymentWindow{ActivationBlock: …}` next to every static address and
  skip the contract whenever the window is not active at the pinned block;
- addresses enumerated on-chain at the pinned block (registry and factory getters)
  are self-gating — a registry cannot return a contract that does not exist yet —
  but the registry contract itself still needs its own window;
- establish a creation block with an `eth_getCode` binary search rather than
  trusting documentation or a first event, and treat it as closed history;
- cover each new window with a boundary regression test.

## Sensitive data

This is a public repository. Never commit secrets or environment-specific
credentials, including:

- RPC URLs, API keys, access keys, bearer tokens, passwords, or private keys;
- authenticated service endpoints or URLs containing tokens or credentials;
- Sentio project names or slugs, owner namespaces, processor identifiers, or
  endpoint paths that embed any of those values;
- `.env` files, local override files, shell history, captured production
  responses, or test fixtures copied from private systems;
- internal hostnames, private network addresses, or deployment credentials.

Use obvious placeholders in examples and tests. Supply required endpoints and
credentials, including Sentio indexer endpoints and processor versions, only at
runtime through the host service's secret/configuration system. Error messages
must redact endpoint URLs.

Before committing or pushing, inspect every new and modified file and scan the
entire repository for credentials and environment-specific endpoints. If there
is any doubt whether a value is sensitive, do not commit it.
