# Repository guidance

## Sensitive data

This is a public repository. Never commit secrets or environment-specific
credentials, including:

- RPC URLs, API keys, access keys, bearer tokens, passwords, or private keys;
- authenticated service endpoints or URLs containing tokens or credentials;
- Sentio project names or slugs, owner namespaces, processor identifiers, or
  endpoint paths that embed any of those values;
- `.env` files, local override files, shell history, captured production
  responses, or test fixtures copied from private systems;
- internal hostnames, private network addresses, or deployment credentials.

Use obvious placeholders in examples and tests. Supply required endpoints and
credentials, including Sentio indexer endpoints and processor versions, only at
runtime through the host service's secret/configuration system. Error messages
must redact endpoint URLs.

Before committing or pushing, inspect every new and modified file and scan the
entire repository for credentials and environment-specific endpoints. If there
is any doubt whether a value is sensitive, do not commit it.
